# Machine Learning Wine Quality Project

Developer: Sierra King

## Initial Exploration
The data set contains information for both red and white wine. The information about the wine includes its chemical properties and the quality of the wine. Most of the data is numerical and it has some missing data. The missing data is filled using the mean of the column.

Predicting: Predict the quality of the wine using its properties. 

## Linear Regression
For the linear regression I have split the data set into the white and red wine data sets. The chemical properties should be different between the two types of wine so I felt that it was necessary to do so. 

Once the data sets were split into red and white wine they were then split into test and training sets with an 80/20 ratio.
