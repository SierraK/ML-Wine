#  Evaluation


## Milestone 2 (40/40 pts)

1. Create Notebook classification
* Data section (5)
* Markdown on feature choice and explanation (5)
* Decision tree (5)
* Metrics computed (5)
* Markdown commments (2/5)
* Try another classifier (5)
* Evaluation on test set (5)
* Markdown discussion of the results (5)
2. Updated the README

I liked the README.  For the final project submission, some of that should be moved into other markdowns.

We have better classifiers, you may want to think about trying one of them.  Also, look at the support vectors to see if you can determine interesting features.
